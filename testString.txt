Travelling

transportation
The
United
Kingdom
of
Great
Britain
has
the
excellent
transport
infrastructure
Not
only
the
huge
tourist
flow
but
also
the
development
of
the
country
itself
and
in
particular
the
business
sphere
contributed
there
The
total
length
of
all
roads
is
at
least
thousand
kilometers
At
the
same
time
there
are
relatively
few
highways
in
the
country
They
make
only
about
three
and
a
half
thousand
kilometers
You
can
travel
by
car
in
any
region
of
the
country
Don't
forget
that
the
UK
has
the
left-hand
traffic
In
London
there
is
a
metro
or
a
tube
that
embraces
underground
land
and
mixed
lines
It
is
worth
noting
that
the
lines
are
often
split
into
separate
small
branches
so
you
should
always
follow
the
transport
route
There
are
also
taxi
services
in
the
country
The
most
expensive
vehicles
are
black
cabs
They
can
be
stopped
simply
on
the
street
Cars
are
always
upscale
with
a
clean
and
comfortable
interior
Drivers
use
a
meter
The
less
expensive
taxi
should
be
called
on
the
phone
In
this
case
you
need
to
clarify
the
price
since
there
is
no
meter
in
the
cabin
Large
cities
have
trams
In
London
you
can
even
find
two-story
trams
However
buses
are
considered
the
most
popular
way
of
traveling
around
the
city
They
run
from
am
until
am
There
are
some
night
routes
As
a
rule
they
only
cruise
around
major
cities
and
the
most
popular
destinations
Tickets
for
public
transport
can
be
bought
at
roadside
kiosks
at
stops
and
railway
stations
as
well
as
directly
from
the
driver
Locals
don't
move
between
cities
by
buses
they
use
trains
instead
It
will
be
much
more
comfortable
although
the
ticket
price
for
trains
is
much
higher
About
years
ago
the
railway
line
across
the
territory
of
the
modern
kingdom
was
in
a
very
poor
state
However
the
authorities
took
action
and
now
the
railway
network
in
the
UK
is
one
of
the
best
in
Europe
The
cost
of
the
ticket
depends
on
the
class
of
the
train
and
the
length
of
the
way
It
is
worth
noting
that
you
can
get
even
to
the
most
remote
villages
Between
the
regions
of
the
kingdom
and
between
coastal
cities
one
can
travel
by
means
of
water
transport
In
particular
you
can
use
ferries
Special
boats
water
taxis
yachts
and
a
variety
of
sightseeing
small
ships
cruise
the
Thames
Air
transport
is
also
decent
in
the
UK
The
country
has
a
lot
of
domestic
and
international
airports
so
moving
between
the
most
remote
points
of
the
state
will
be
quick
and
comfortable
In
addition
the
cost
of
air
tickets
is
quite
acceptable
It
is
possible
to
move
around
the
city
by
bicycles
Authorities
zealously
support
this
trend
so
they
constantly
expand
the
network
of
bicycle
lanes
You
can
rent
a
two-wheeled
vehicle
in
any
town
This
is
especially
true
in
larger
cities
where
the
ancient
streets
are
very
narrow
and
the
traffic
jams
can
be
as
long
as
several
kilometers
You
can
also
rent
a
car
but
only
with
an
international
driver's
license
Such
an
option
will
cost
you
at
least
per
day
Main
airports
and
avia
transportation
The
air
transport
network
in
Great
Britain
is
simply
superb
In
total
about
airports
operate
in
the
country
Some
of
them
are
used
not
only
for
passenger
transportation
but
also
for
freight
The
main
airports
serve
domestic
and
international
flights
Heathrow
Airport
is
the
largest
air
harbor
in
the
country
It
is
located
twenty
kilometers
from
London
It
has
no
equal
on
the
territory
of
the
kingdom
Heathrow
holds
a
decent
place
in
the
world
There
are
five
terminals
at
the
airport
Everything
there
is
arranged
for
the
comfortable
rest
of
passengers
including
bank
offices
cafes
and
restaurants
various
shops
lounges
business
centers
and
baby
care
rooms
You
can
get
to
the
city
by
bus
or
by
train
You
can
also
book
a
transfer
and
a
taxi
in
advance
or
rent
a
car
Gatwick
Airport
is
on
a
second
place
in
the
country
Although
it
is
the
busiest
airport
in
the
world
by
its
capacity
It
has
two
terminals
between
which
a
line
of
underground
trains
lies
An
infrastructure
of
the
air
harbor
is
nice
Here
you
can
find
souvenir
shops
and
boutiques
nurseries
and
meeting
rooms
restaurants
and
cafes
It
should
be
noted
that
hotels
are
located
right
on
the
territory
This
airport
is
situated
kilometers
from
London
On
the
opposite
side
at
the
same
distance
from
the
capital
there
is
Stansted
Airport
It
is
famous
for
its
unusual
architecture
and
high-quality
service
Manchester
Airport
is
located
near
the
city
of
the
same
name
Its
scale
is
not
very
impressive
if
compared
to
the
first
three
air
harbors
Still
the
quality
of
service
is
also
great.
There
are
a
railway
station
and
a
bus
station
on
the
territory
of
the
airport
Scottish
Edinburgh
Airport
is
just
kilometers
from
the
city
of
the
same
name
This
harbor
has
recently
become
international
This
direction
is
very
popular
today
Gibraltar
Airport
serves
not
only
civilian
but
military
forces
The
Bristol
air
gate
is
one
of
the
ten
busiest
airports
in
the
whole
kingdom
There
is
only
one
international
airport
on
the
territory
of
Wales
Cardiff
It
is
located
only
kilometers
from
the
city
You
can
get
there
by
bus
or
by
train
Railway

and

transport
The
UK
is
characterized
by
a
rather
developed
transport
infrastructure
It
is
comfortable
to
travel
by
any
mean
of
transport
The
state
monitors
the
condition
of
the
fleet
trains
planes
and
sea
transport
Therefore
the
cost
of
a
journey
is
quite
comparable
to
the
quality
of
service
and
comfortable
roads
Very
few
travelers
choose
a
car
as
the
main
mean
of
transportation
around
the
country
The
traffic
is
left-handed
and
most
tourists
are
simply
not
accustomed
to
this
It
can
be
a
problem
to
drive
in
the
largest
tourist
cities
by
car
because
all
the
ancient
streets
are
very
narrow
That
is
especially
true
for
London
Nevertheless
you
can
rent
a
car
in
every
airport
or
in
a
large
city
A
bicycle
can
be
an
option
Almost
all
the
cities
of
the
country
have
branched
bike
lanes
Therefore
it
will
be
possible
not
only
to
get
to
the
desired
destination
quickly
and
inexpensively
but
also
to
admire
the
surrounding
nature
The
most
popular
public
transport
in
the
country
is
a
bus
Inside
the
city
buses
run
in
different
directions
every
minutes
There
are
lines
working
from
am
to
am
There
are
night
buses
on
the
most
popular
routes
On
holidays
the
amount
of
transport
is
significantly
reduced
You
can
buy
bus
tickets
at
roadside
kiosks
at
bus
stops
or
at
train
stations
and
directly
from
the
driver
You
can
buy
a
one-time
ticket
or
a
travel
card
In
the
second
case
you
can
save
a
little
Long-distance
buses
as
a
rule
depart
from
bus
stations
every
hour
Much
attention
is
paid
to
the
comfort
Some
companies
offer
their
passengers
drinks
and
light
snacks
Oxford
Two-story
red
buses
are
the
feature
of
the
UK.
However
few
people
have
heard
about
red
double-decker
trams
Although
they
are
quite
common
in
London
Such
mean
pf
transport
appeared
in
the
capital
years
ago
Later
it
disappeared
and
only
a
few
years
ago
local
authorities
returned
such
transport
to
the
city
It
is
worth
noting
that
you
can
buy
a
travel
card
which
allows
traveling
by
bus
and
by
tram
Also
the
metro
is
very
popular
in
the
capital
This
one
is
among
the
oldest
in
the
world
There
are
only
lines
Many
of
them
are
mixed
and
have
land
and
underground
sections
The
branches
themselves
are
rather
confused
so
when
traveling
you
should
closely
follow
the
route
map
Please
note
that
hitch-hiking
is
common
in
the
UK
This
type
of
transportation
is
safe
and
inexpensive
The
UK
has
a
very
long
railway
network
That's
one
of
the
best
in
Europe
The
most
remote
regions
of
the
country
can
be
reached
by
means
of
such
transport
In
order
to
save
a
little
it
is
worth
buying
tickets
one
or
two
weeks
in
advance
You
can
also
get
a
reusable
ticket
The
speed
of
most
of
the
trains
in
England
reaches
two
hundred
kilometers
per
hour
The
cars
are
clean
and
comfortable
Trains
run
according
to
the
schedule
The
maximum
delay
time
is
minutes
The
cost
depends
on
the
duration
of
the
trip
the
point
of
departure
and
the
class
of
a
train
or
a
car
To
save
time
many
tourists
travel
between
the
most
famous
cities
of
the
kingdom
by
air
There
are
about
air
harbors
in
the
country
Domestic
flights
are
available
at
almost
every
airport
You
can
get
there
by
buses
trains
transfers
or
by
taxi
Since
the
United
Kingdom
is
an
island
state
there
is
a
well-developed
sea
transport
You
can
move
between
the
mainland
and
coastal
cities
by
ships
and
ferries
Moreover
the
second
type
of
transport
is
more
popular
among
tourists
Firstly
its
cost
is
low
Secondly
it
is
possible
to
transport
any
goods
and
even
cars
or
bicycles
on
ferries
In
the
midst
of
the
tourist
season
water
taxis
yachts
and
excursion
boats
run
on
Thames
in
London
You
can
also
take
a
taxi
There
are
two
main
types
of
taxis
with
meters
and
with
a
fixed
tariff
In
the
first
case
such
a
car
can
be
taken
on
the
street
The
second
type
of
taxi
can
be
called
only
by
phone
Don't
forget
to

National
traditions
of
Great
Britain
Habits
mentality
and
the
way
of
living
The
United
Kingdom
embraces
several
historical
provinces
under
its
flag
The
mentality
of
the
inhabitants
isn't
similar
Irish
Scots
Welsh
and
English
differ
with
traditions
temperament
and
even
languages
The
stereotype
of
stiffness
and
indifference
of
the
British
has
a
reason
They
really
know
how
to
hide
emotions
and
demonstrate
an
equal
attitude
to
everything
that
is
happening
Locals
are
incredibly
punctual
and
polite
they
try
to
avoid
contentious
issues
and
conflicts
The
English
have
an
incredible
self-control
It
is
almost
impossible
to
get
them
out
of
their
minds
They
are
taught
from
their
childhood
how
to
manage
all
possible
difficulties.
Nevertheless
these
people
are
characterized
by
the
snobbery
and
vanity
Englishmen
rarely
use
denial
or
assertion
Most
often
they
answer
I
think
or
maybe
They
listen
attentively
without
interrupting
but
even
a
smile
can
hardly
mean
that
an
interlocutor
agrees
The
concept
of
English
humor
is
widely
known
in
the
world
Despite
their
emotional
stinginess
the
British
like
to
joke
They
make
fun
of
themselves
the
royal
family
and
the
church
Their
humor
is
quite
specific
and
is
not
understood
by
everyone
The
British
seek
to
preserve
their
identity
They
are
separated
from
the
rest
of
Europe
not
only
territorially
but
also
culturally
This
country
is
the
only
one
in
Europe
where
cars
are
still
moving
along
the
left
side
of
the
road
The
UK
managed
to
keep
its
currency
and
a
measure
of
distance
UK
with
all
its
cultural
versatility
has
a
lot
of
authentic
traditions
The
most
striking
of
these
is
the
traditional
tea
party
A
table
for
tea
has
to
stand
near
the
fireplace
which
is
the
coziest
place
of
the
house
It
is
covered
with
a
snow-white
or
blue
tablecloth
Utensils
from
one
set
are
used
different
cups
and
saucers
are
considered
bad
form
There
must
be
a
tea
set
on
the
table
It
includes
a
teapot
a
jug
of
boiling
water
a
milkman
dessert
plates
forks
and
knives
a
strainer
stand
a
sugar
bowl
with
tongs
and
a
wool
cover
that
is
put
on
a
jug
with
boiling
water
Toast
butter
eggs
sweet
and
unsweetened
pastries
jams
and
cookies
are
served
too
In
a
small
village
lived
a
young
boy
named
Jack
He
was
always
cheerful
and
full
of
energy
Every
day
he
would
wake
up
early
in
the
morning
and
help
his
parents
with
the
household
chores
Jack
loved
to
explore
the
nearby
forest
and
play
with
his
friends
in
the
meadow
He
would
climb
trees
and
chase
after
butterflies
never
getting
tired
of
all
the
fun
and
adventure
One
day
Jack
stumbled
upon
a
mysterious
cave
hidden
deep
in
the
woods
The
entrance
was
dark
and
ominous
but
Jack's
curiosity
got
the
better
of
him
He
bravely
stepped
inside
his
heart
racing
with
excitement
The
cave
was
filled
with
strange
symbols
and
glowing
crystals
casting
an
eerie
light
on
the
walls
Jack
felt
a
sense
of
wonder
and
awe
as
he
ventured
further
into
the
unknown
depths
of
the
cave
Suddenly
he
heard
a
faint
whisper
coming
from
the
shadows
Who
dares
to
enter
my
domain
a
booming
voice
echoed
through
the
cavern
Jack
froze
in
fear
not
sure
what
to
do
next
But
his
natural
curiosity
and
bravery
pushed
him
forward
towards
the
source
of
the
voice
As
he
reached
a
large
chamber
at
the
heart
of
the
cave
Jack
saw
a
magnificent
dragon
lying
in
wait
The
dragon's
scales
shimmered
in
the
dim
light
its
eyes
glowing
with
intelligence
and
power
Jack
was
awestruck
by
the
sight
before
him
but
he
felt
a
strange
connection
to
the
creature
Something
deep
inside
him
told
him
that
this
dragon
was
not
a
threat
but
a
friend
in
need
I
am
the
guardian
of
this
cave
young
human
the
dragon
spoke
in
a
voice
that
rumbled
like
thunder
I
have
been
waiting
for
someone
like
you
to
come
and
help
me
with
a
great
task
Jack
listened
intently
his
heart
pounding
with
excitement
What
do
you
need
me
to
do
mighty
dragon
he
asked
eager
to
prove
his
worth
There
is
a
powerful
evil
that
threatens
this
land
a
darkness
that
seeks
to
consume
all
life
the
dragon
explained
I
alone
cannot
defeat
it
but
with
your
help
we
may
stand
a
chance
Jack
nodded
solemnly
ready
to
accept
the
challenge
I
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
protect
my
home
and
the
ones
I
love
he
declared
The
dragon
smiled
a
rare
sight
for
such
a
fearsome
creature
Then
let
us
join
forces
and
face
the
darkness
together
young
hero
it
said
extending
a
claw
towards
Jack
The
boy
reached
out
and
clasped
the
dragon's
claw
firmly
sealing
their
bond
with
a
silent
promise
They
emerged
from
the
cave
as
a
united
front
ready
to
confront
the
evil
that
threatened
their
world
With
Jack's
courage
and
the
dragon's
strength
they
set
out
to
vanquish
the
darkness
once
and
for
all
And
so
a
great
adventure
began
one
that
would
test
their
limits
and
forge
a
bond
that
would
last
for
eternity
Together
they
faced
countless
trials
and
tribulations
but
through
unwavering
determination
and
trust
in
each
other
they
emerged
victorious
in
the
end
The
land
was
saved
and
Jack
became
a
hero
in
the
eyes
of
all
who
knew
him
But
deep
down
he
knew
that
he
owed
it
all
to
the
dragon
who
had
believed
in
him
from
the
very
start
And
so
the
boy
and
the
dragon
remained
friends
for
life
embarking
on
new
adventures
and
facing
new
challenges
side
by
side
Their
story
became
a
legend
passed
down
through
the
generations
as
a
tale
of
courage
friendship
and
the
power
of
believing
in
oneself
And
in
the
quiet
village
where
it
all
began
Jack
and
his
dragon
lived
on,
ready
to
face
whatever
challenges
the
future
may
bring
together
as
one
Here

the
world
is
a
vast
and
complex
place
filled
with
a
multitude
of
cultures

societies
each
with
their

unique
histories
traditions
and
ways
of
life
from
the
bustling
metropolises
of
the
developed
world
to
the
remote
villages
of
the
developing
nations
the
diversity
of
human
experience
is
truly
astounding
in
our
modern
era
of
globalization
and
interconnectedness
we
have
unprecedented
access
to
information
and
the
ability
to
connect
with
people
from
all
corners
of
the
globe
yet
despite
this
increased
exposure
to
different
ways
of
living
many
of
us
still
struggle
to
truly
understand
and
appreciate
the
richness
of
our
shared
humanity
beneath
the
surface
level
differences
that
divide
us
lie
deep-seated
commonalities
that
bind
us
together
as
a
species
we
all
share
the
fundamental
needs
for
food
water
shelter
and
safety
we
all
experience
the
full
range
of
human
emotions
from
joy
and
love
to
sorrow
and
fear
we
all
grapple
with
the
existential
questions
of
our
purpose
and
place
in
the
universe
and
we
all
strive
to
find
meaning
and
fulfillment
in
our
lives
in
the
face
of
the
many
challenges
and
uncertainties
that
confront
us
as
we
navigate
the
complexities
of
the
modern
world
it
is
easy
to
become
overwhelmed
by
the
sheer
scale
and
pace
of
change
all
around
us
the
rapid
advancements
in
technology
the
shifting
geopolitical
landscapes
the
ever-evolving
social
and
cultural
norms
it
can
feel
like
the
ground
is
constantly
shifting
beneath
our
feet
and
it
can
be
tempting
to
retreat
into
our
own
insular
bubbles
where
we
can
feel
safe
and
in
control
but
to
do
so
would
be
to
miss
out
on
the
incredible
opportunities
for
growth
and
understanding
that
come
from
engaging
with
the
wider
world
around
us
one
of
the
most
powerful
ways
to
expand
our
horizons
and
deepen
our
appreciation
for
the
diversity
of
human
experience
is
through
the
act
of
travel
whether
it
is
venturing
to
a
new
city
in
our
own
country
or
embarking
on
an
international
journey
the
experience
of
immersing
ourselves
in
unfamiliar
environments
and
encountering
different
ways
of
life
can
be
truly
transformative
it
challenges
us
to
step
outside
of
our
comfort
zones
to
confront
our
own
biases
and
preconceptions
and
to
see
the
world
through
a
new
lens
when
we
travel
we
are
forced
to
grapple
with
the
discomfort
of
the
unknown
we
must
navigate
unfamiliar
languages
customs
and
social
norms
we
may
encounter
language
barriers
cultural
misunderstandings
and
even
outright
hostility
from
those
who
view
us
as
outsiders
but
it
is
precisely
these
moments
of
discomfort
and
uncertainty
that
offer
us
the
greatest
opportunities
for
growth
and
self-discovery
by
pushing
us
out
of
our
familiar
routines
and
forcing
us
to
adapt
and
problem-solve
in
new
ways
travel
can
help
us
to
develop
greater
flexibility
resilience
and
empathy
moreover
the
act
of
travel
itself
can
be
a
deeply
enriching
and
fulfilling
experience
as
we
encounter
new
sights
sounds
and
sensations
that
awaken
our
senses
and
ignite
our
curiosity
we
may
stumble
upon
hidden
gems
of
architecture
or
natural
beauty
that
take
our
breath
away
we
may
engage
in
conversations
with
locals
that
challenge
our
preconceptions
and
open
our
minds
to
new
perspectives
and
we
may
even
discover
unexpected
connections
and
commonalities
with
people
from
vastly
different
backgrounds
of
course
the
benefits
of
travel
extend
far
beyond
the
individual
level
as
well
when
we
venture
out
into
the
world
and
engage
with
diverse
cultures
and
communities
we
have
the
opportunity
to
build
bridges
of
understanding
and
connection
that
can
help
to
break
down
the
barriers
of
prejudice
and
intolerance
that
so
often
divide
us
as
a
global
society
by
fostering
greater
cross-cultural
exchange
and
collaboration
we
can
work
towards
a
more
peaceful
and
equitable
world
where
our
differences
are
celebrated
rather
than
feared
in
an
age
of
increasing
polarization
and
social
fragmentation
the
act
of
travel
can
be
a
powerful
antidote
offering
us
a
means
to
transcend
our
own
limited
perspectives
and
to
cultivate
a
deeper
sense
of
our
shared
humanity

the
remote

the
developing

the
diversity
of
human
experience
is
truly
astounding
in
our
modern

yet
despite

many

the

full
range

human
emotions
from
joy

sorrow

we
all
grapple
with
the

we

it

all
around
us
the
rapid

the

constantly

it
can
be
tempting
to
retreat
into
our
own
insular
bubbles
where
we
can
feel
safe

to
do

be
to
miss
out

the

when

the
unknown
we
must

we

it
is
precisely
these
moments
of
discomfort
and
uncertainty
that
offer
us
the
greatest
opportunities
for
growth
and
self-discovery
by
pushing
us
out
of
our
familiar
routines
and
forcing
us
to
adapt
and
problem-solve
in
new
ways
travel
can
help
us
to
develop
greater
flexibility
resilience
and
empathy
moreover
the
act
of
travel
itself
can
be
a
deeply
enriching
and
fulfilling
experience
as
we
encounter
new
sights
sounds
and
sensations
that
awaken
our
senses
and
ignite
our
curiosity
we
may
stumble
upon
hidden
gems
of
architecture
or
natural
beauty
that
take
our
breath
away
we
may
engage
in
conversations
with
locals
that
challenge
our
preconceptions
and
open
our
minds
to
new
perspectives
and
we
may
even
discover
unexpected
connections
and
commonalities
with
people
from
vastly
different
backgrounds
of
course
the
benefits
of
travel
extend
far
beyond
the
individual
level
as
well
when
we
venture
out
into
the
world
and
engage
with
diverse
cultures
and
communities
we
have
the
opportunity
to
build
bridges
of
understanding
and
connection
that
can
help
to
break
down
the
barriers
of
prejudice
and
intolerance
that
so
often
divide
us
as
a
global
society
by
fostering
greater
cross-cultural
exchange
and
collaboration
we
can
work
towards
a
more
peaceful
and
equitable
world
where
our
differences
are
celebrated
rather
than
feared
in
an
age
of
increasing
polarization
and
social
fragmentation
the
act
of
travel
can
be
a
powerful
antidote
offering
us
a
means
to
transcend
our
own
limited
perspectives
and
to
cultivate
